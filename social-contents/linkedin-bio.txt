DeFAI Mint: Belief as Strategy. NFT as AI Agent.

DeFAI Mint radically simplifies DeFi × AI. No dashboards. No token lists. No strategy setup. Just one action: minting an NFT.

Each DeFAI NFT is a belief turned into an AI agent. It holds its own wallet, signs transactions, and trades across chains—fully autonomous, fully on-chain. No need for a Solana wallet. No need to hold $SOL. Twitter login and cross-chain support are built in.

Why now? Because DeFi × AI has become exclusive—benefiting only those with access, time, and expertise. DeFAI Mint makes investing accessible to everyone, powered not by fear or FOMO, but by conviction.

Built 100% on Solana’s execution layer, DeFAI Mint leverages:

Metaplex Execute (each NFT becomes a signer),

Solana Agent Kit v2 (cross-dApp autonomous agents),

Walrus (permanent, censorship-resistant metadata storage).

This is belief-driven automation—where ideas become investment strategies.

Our mission? Flatten access to DeFi × AI. From privilege to public good. We aim to grow Solana’s ecosystem by 10,000×—starting with a single mint.
