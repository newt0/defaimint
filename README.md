## 🚀 What is DeFAI Mint?

DeFAI Mint is a radical simplification of DeFi × AI.  
Users mint an NFT that acts as a self-sovereign AI agent — holding its own wallet, signing transactions, and executing belief-aligned strategies.

Built for both DeFi veterans and newcomers, DeFAI Mint removes all complexity from crypto investing.  
**It’s not DeFi as you know it — it’s DeFi as it should be.**
