Imagine minting an NFT once —  
and never worrying about DeFi again.

We present DeFAI Mint.  

Our slogan:  
"Mint to DeFAI. Vibe trading as NFT."

Crypto has surpassed human capacity.

140,000+ tokens launch daily.  

Protocols splinter.  
Volatility never ends.

AI was meant to help.  
Instead, it became a weapon —  
for experts only.

They get smarter.  
They get richer.  
Everyone else falls behind.

AI isn't the great equalizer.  
It's the great divider.

That's why we built DeFAI Mint —  
a new interface where belief,  
not expertise, drives investing.

We call it "Vibe Trading" —  
a radical simplification of crypto investing,  
reduced to just one action:  
minting an NFT.

No token picking.  
No strategy setup.

Just mint —  
and your NFT becomes your AI agent.

It holds a wallet,  
signs and trades autonomously.

This is belief-driven automation —  
not DeFi as we know it,  
but DeFi as it should be.

Each DeFi NFT represents a conviction —  
political, philosophical, or protocol-based.

You don't choose tokens.  
You choose what you stand for.

Then the agent trades accordingly —  
autonomously across chains.

Letting AI manage your money feels risky.  
That's why we designed DeFAI Mint  
with two principles:  
Safety and Simplicity.

Your mint price = your trade budget.  
No overexposure.

Each NFT has its own wallet.  
Your funds stay
