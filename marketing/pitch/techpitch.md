## 🎤 DeFAI Mint 技術ピッチ（語り口調・3 分以内）

### ✅ 1. **SOLUTION**

Let me show you something different.

In DeFAI Mint, when you mint an NFT, you're not just collecting a JPEG.

You're minting an AI agent — with its own wallet, its own private key, and its own logic.

As soon as it's minted, the funds go directly into the NFT’s wallet.
From there, the NFT acts entirely on its own — executing trades, signing transactions, even making decisions.

It’s not just a token. It’s a self-contained financial entity — working for you.

### ✅ 2. **HOW IT WORKS**

So how does this NFT know what to do?

It all comes down to belief.

Each NFT represents a **belief-driven strategy**.
You don’t configure settings or read charts — you choose a conviction.

For example, a **TRUMP NFT** watches his social media in real time.
When he posts, the NFT may snipe meme tokens — fast, automatic, and aligned with the narrative.

Or maybe you pick a **“Solana Forever” NFT** — it sticks to Solana-native assets, auto-farming, LPing, or buying dips.

What you believe... becomes what you trade.

### ✅ 3. **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

Now, how is all this possible?

The magic starts with **Metaplex Execute** — it turns NFTs into on-chain actors that can sign and send transactions themselves.

Then we use **Solana Agent Kit v2** — it’s like an SDK for autonomous agents. It lets the NFT monitor data from Twitter, DeFi protocols, APIs, and react in real time.

Strategy metadata — your belief, your parameters — are stored on **Walrus**, a fast, distributed, and immutable storage layer.

This stack is fast, composable, and 100% Solana-native. That’s how we make it work.

### ✅ 4. **FEATURES**

And most importantly — it’s safe.

The NFT holds the wallet. Not you.

You never give away your private key. You don’t have to trust the AI.

The AI lives inside the NFT, and it can only act within its own wallet.

This creates a natural **safety layer** between users and smart contracts — protecting your assets while keeping the system autonomous.

## ✅ 終わりに

Mint once.
Let your belief become an agent.
And let that agent trade on your behalf.

That’s DeFAI Mint.
