# âœ… DeFAI-Mint â€” 3-Minute Script for ElevenLabs

Imagine minting an NFT once â€” and never worrying about Dee-Fye again.

We present De-Fay-Mint.

Our slogan â€”  
Mint to Deh-Fay-Eye.  
Vibe Trading as NFT.

### ðŸ”¥ MARKET REALITY

Crypto has surpassed human capacity.
140,000+ tokens launch daily.  
Protocols splinter. Volatility never ends.

Ay-Eye was meant to help.  
Instead, it became a weapon â€” for experts only.

They get smarter.  
They get richer.  
Everyone else falls behind.

Ay-Eye isnâ€™t the great equalizer.  
Itâ€™s the great divider.

Thatâ€™s why we built De-Fay-Mint â€”  
a new interface where belief, not expertise, drives investing.

### ðŸ’¡ SOLUTION: Vibe Trading

We call it Vibe Trading â€”  
a radical simplification of crypto investing, reduced to just one action: minting an NFT.

No token picking.  
No strategy setup.  
Just mint â€” and your NFT becomes your AI-agent.

It holds a wallet, signs, and trades autonomously.

This is belief-driven automation â€”  
not Dee-Fye as we know it,  
but Dee-Fye as it should be.

### ðŸ§­ HOW IT WORKS

Each Deh-Fay-Eye NFT embodies a conviction â€”
political, philosophical, or protocol-based.

You donâ€™t just pick assets.
You pick a belief.
A thesis.

Then the agent takes over â€”
trading in line with what you stand for.
Fully automated.
Fully on-chain.

### ðŸ›¡ FEATURES: Safe & Effortless

Letting Ay-Eye manage your money sounds risky.  
So we designed De-Fay-Mint around two things:  
**Safety. And simplicity.**

Your mint price = your trade budget.  
Each NFT holds its own wallet.  
Your funds stay isolated.

No wallet? No Sohl? No problem.  
Just log in with Twitter and mint â€” even without holding Sohl.  
Cross-chain ready by default.

Once minted, your agent runs on its own.  
No dashboards. No friction.

This is Dee-Fye, simplified.

### ðŸ§  TECH: Built on Solana

NFT = AI-agent isnâ€™t just a concept.
Itâ€™s real â€” and only possible on Solana.

Metaplex-Execute gives each NFT its own private key.
Solana-Agent-Kit-v2 is the best dev toolkit for crypto-native Ay-Eye.

De-Fay-Mint isnâ€™t portable.
Itâ€™s Solana-native by design.

### ðŸŽ¯ VISION

Today, Dee-Fye and Ay-Eye is a privilege â€” not a public good.

Our mission is To flatten access.
So that anyone can invest â€” by simply minting a belief.

From UX to capital to conviction â€”
we simplify it all.

100Ã— users.
10,000Ã— transactions.

One mint.
All on Solana.

Letâ€™s Mint to Deh-Fay-Eye.
